        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          The Paris 2024 Olympics are right around the corner, which means that
          there is still time to train and create strategies. The Olympics are a series of sports to challenge the top athletes around the world to found out who are the greatest athletes. Data 
          from each year is recorded and stored such as the number of medals won, the athletes' names, and their countries they represent. This is great for us as we can use this data and
          try to find patterns to predict the next year's dominating country. Using Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Plotly, I have simplified some data to know what expect at the Olympics this year.

      <!--Common information-->
        <div class="main">
          <h1>Top Competitors</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The top competitors in the olympics for the last 8 years were the United States, China, Japan, Great Britian, and Russia. 
              These 5 countries won the most medals compared to the other countries. This can be confirmed by taking a look at the graphs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="main">
          <h1>Who has been winning the most Olympic games?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>The United States has been winning the most Olympic games since the last two olympics. They have won the most gold, silver, and bronze medals each <time datetime=""></time>.</li>

            <p>The bar graph above is a visualization of the medals won in the 2016 Olympics. As you can see, the United States is stacked much higher compared to all the other countries. This
              means that they have won more medals than the other countries.

          <div class="gallery-item">

            <p>This bar graph is also a visualization of the medals won but in the 2021 Olympics. As you can see again, the trend of the United States being at the top is apparent once again.</p>

          <p>Based on the data collected, there is a very strong chance that the United States will perform exceptionally well again this year. Their consistent dominance in previous 
            years is likely to continue in this year's events. The United States has proven that they can win, with the outstanding talent of their athletes and the rigorous training
             they endure to have a chance to compete.
